# API (Application Programming Interface)
- it's essentially a set of rules and protocols that define how different software can interact with each other.

# HTTP Protocol 
- GET
- POST
- PUT
- PATCH
- DELETE

# API Documentation
- the collection of references, tutorials, and examples that help developers use your API

# API Endpoints
- BaseURL/Endpoint
- the endpoint is basically a different route on the API provider server and in the documentation
they will usually give you an example of which endpoints you can use and what is the purpose of that
endpoint. Let's go ahead and try an exercise on Postman.

# Single/Multiple Query Parameters
- BaseURL/endpoint?query=value
- Start query with question mark
- simply adding an ampersand(&) after the first query (BaseURL/endpoint?query=value&query2=value)
- use to filtering or searching

# Path Parameters
- BaseURL/endpoint/{path-parameter}
- identifying a resource by some specific parameter

# JSON
- JavaScript Object Notation
- JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data
- Serialization : turning JavaScript Object into a JSON (JSON.stringify)
- Deserialization : turning back a JSON to JavaScript Object (JSON.parse)

# Authentication & Authorization
- So the difference between these two forms is if you have a user, they can authenticate themselves with your service.
That means you are logging in or you are registering. But authorization is simply a client who is allowed to use your service with an API key that might be associated with a user, in which case they are authenticating themselves and then getting an API key to authorize themselves to use your API.
- No Authentication
- Basic Authentication is required for some endpoints. Use your username and password to authenticate.
- API Key Authorization is required to Authorize certain endpoints.
- Token Based Authorization is required for some endpoints. Use your username and password to get a token obtained
